DirectX11_Workshop
===================

Creating boilerplate code for DirectX projects to use in extending off to other projects or tinker with ideas.

1. Project Uses Property Sheets rather than vcxproj configuration. This allows a property sheets to share some settings, have specific sheets for others, making maintenance easier.
2. Visual Studio 2013. Has great DirectX debugger, C++11, and C++ refactoring. All very convenient.
3. DirectX Toolkit (DXTK). Plenty of handy boilerplate functions that are great for getting something on screen without having to write some sections of boilerplate code.
4. Pempek Assert library. Great for having more robust and customizable asserts. Must have to catch those cases where the code fails as early as possible.
