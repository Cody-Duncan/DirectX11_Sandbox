DirectX11_Workshop
===================

Creating boilerplate code for DirectX projects to use in extending off to other projects or tinker with ideas.

1. Project Uses Property Sheets rather than vcxproj configuration. This allows a property sheets to share some settings, have specific sheets for others, making maintenance easier.
2. Using Visual Studio 2013. Has great DirectX debugger, C++11, and C++ refactoring. All very convenient.
